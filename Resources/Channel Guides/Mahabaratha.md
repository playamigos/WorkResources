### Requirements
- Highest quality possible (based of character references)
- Situation based visual (No dialogue or lipsync should be present in the visual)
- Sync to story-based Song
- Focus or prioritise over Visual presentation (Images generated should directly convey the intent/emotion of scene & video generated should compliment that)
- Use wide variety of shot from Extreme close-up to extreme wide shots based of shot necesity (Find different types of shots in the Camera guide.)
- Nothing works in the first try, the images below took 5-10 tries to get one perfect one.
- When direct storytelling is boring present indirectly.
- We are not just matching visual to song, Even without the song, the story of Mahabaratha has to be sequentially conveyed.

#### Sulabha feeding krishna banana peels
```text
Lord Krishna, with a gentle and serene smile, is seated on a simple cushion on the floor of a humble, traditional Indian home. 
He is gracefully accepting a banana peel from an woman, Vidura's wife (Sulabha), who is kneeling before him in a state of profound, ecstatic devotion. 
Her face shows pure bliss and absorption. Several banana fruit without peel are already on the floor beside Krishna, and he is about to eat one peel, showing clear relish. 
The atmosphere is warm, softly lit, and filled with deep spiritual love and humility. 
The home is sparsely furnished but radiates peace. Vidura(a member of royal court) stands in the background, just entering, his expression a mix of shock and eventual understanding.  
krishna eating peels leaving the actual fruit.
