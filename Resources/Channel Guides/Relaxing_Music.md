## Production Workflow

### 1. Audio Production

#### Relaxing Music
- **Tool:** Suno AI
- **Style Guidelines:**
  - Slow tempo (60-80 BPM)
  - Minimal percussion
  - Soft instrumentation (piano, strings, ambient pads)
  - No sudden changes or jarring transitions
  - Seamless loop capability
- **Prompt Tips:**
  - "Ambient meditation music, soft piano"
  - "Relaxing nature soundscape, minimal melody"
  - "Lo-fi chill beats, calm atmosphere"
  - "Zen meditation music, peaceful ambience"

#### Ambient Sounds
- **Source:** Envato Elements (stock audio)
- **Categories:**
  - Nature: Rain, ocean waves, forest birds, wind, thunder
  - Environment: Fireplace crackling, cafe ambience, library sounds
  - White noise: Pink noise, brown noise, static
  - ASMR: Water flowing, wind chimes, gentle bells
- **Mixing Tips:**
  - Balance ambient sounds at 20-40% volume relative to music
  - Ensure ambient loops are seamless
  - Layer 2-3 compatible ambient sounds for depth

### 2. Visual Production

#### Image Generation
- **Tool:** Google Whisk
- **Visual Themes:**
  - Natural landscapes (mountains, forests, beaches, rivers)
  - Cozy interiors (fireplaces, rainy windows, libraries)
  - Space and cosmos (galaxies, nebulae, northern lights)
  - Abstract calming visuals (flowing colors, gentle patterns)
  - Zen gardens and meditation spaces

#### Video Creation
- **Tool:** Flow (or similar)
- **Critical Setup:**
  - Use the **same image** for first and last frame
  - This creates a perfect loop when video repeats
  - Generate 5-10 second base loops
  - Ensure smooth, slow motion (no quick movements)
- **Motion Guidelines:**
  - Gentle camera movements (slow pan, subtle zoom)
  - Natural elements (swaying trees, drifting clouds)
  - Flowing water or fire
  - Avoid abrupt direction changes

### 3. Final Assembly

#### Editing Checklist
- [ ] Extend looping video to full duration (1.5-3 hours)
- [ ] Layer relaxing music track
- [ ] Add ambient sound layer(s)
- [ ] Mix audio levels appropriately
- [ ] Test loop points for seamlessness
- [ ] Add subtle fade in/out at start/end (5-10 seconds)
- [ ] Export in high quality (1080p minimum, 4K preferred)
